We currently support 3 of the 7 classic tetromino shapes:

### I-Piece (Cyan)

## Rotation System
We use the Standard Rotation System (SRS):
- All rotations are around the center of the 4x4 matrix
- Pieces can rotate both clockwise and counter-clockwise
- Wall kicks (adjusting position during rotation) will be implemented later

## Planned Features
